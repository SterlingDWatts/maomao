      <>
        Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous
        humanoid creatures called Titans, forcing humans to hide in fear behind
        enormous concentric walls. What makes these giants truly terrifying is
        that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what
        appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of
        humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one
        hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile
        calm is soon shattered when a colossal Titan manages to breach the
        supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival
        against the man-eating abominations.
        <br />
        <br />
        After witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading
        creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by
        enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the
        merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Eren, his
        adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman, and his childhood friend Armin Arlert
        join the brutal war against the Titans and race to discover a way of
        defeating them before the last walls are breached.

        After a horrific alchemy experiment goes wrong in the Elric household,
        brothers Edward and Alphonse are left in a catastrophic new reality.
        Ignoring the alchemical principle banning human transmutation, the boys
        attempted to bring their recently deceased mother back to life. Instead,
        they suffered brutal personal loss: Alphonse's body disintegrated while
        Edward lost a leg and then sacrificed an arm to keep Alphonse's soul in
        the physical realm by binding it to a hulking suit of armor.
        <br />
        <br />
        The brothers are rescued by their neighbor Pinako Rockbell and her
        granddaughter Winry. Known as a bio-mechanical engineering prodigy,
        Winry creates prosthetic limbs for Edward by utilizing "automail," a
        tough, versatile metal used in robots and combat armor. After years of
        training, the Elric brothers set off on a quest to restore their bodies
        by locating the Philosopher's Stone—a powerful gem that allows an
        alchemist to defy the traditional laws of Equivalent Exchange.
        <br />
        <br />
        As Edward becomes an infamous alchemist and gains the nickname
        "Fullmetal," the boys' journey embroils them in a growing conspiracy
        that threatens the fate of the world.

        proposes that the two join the Hero Association in order to become

        Ever since having witnessed the "Little Giant" and his astonishing
        skills on the volleyball court, Shouyou Hinata has been bewitched by the
        dynamic nature of the sport. Even though his attempt to make his debut

        When Hinata enrolls in Karasuno High School, the Little Giant's alma

        To fulfill his desire of leaving a mark on the realm of volleyball—so

        discovers that said home is a rundown shrine, she tries to leave;
        however, she is caught by two shrine spirits and a fox familiar named
        Tomoe. They mistake her for the man Nanami rescued—the land god of the
        shrine, Mikage. Realizing that Mikage must have sent her there as a
        replacement god, Tomoe leaves abruptly, refusing to serve a human.

        Rather than going back to being homeless, Nanami immerses herself in her

        seek out Tomoe, she lands in trouble and ends up sealing a contract with
        him. Now the two must traverse the path of godhood together as god and
        familiar; but it will not be easy, for new threats arise in the form of
        a youkai who wants to devour the girl, a snake that wants to marry her,
        and Nanami's own unexpected feelings for her new familiar.
